# Spellings Quiz - A platform to check and practice your english spellings skills

The Spellings Quiz, is an application mainly created for younger kids, so that they can check and practice their english spellings skills in a very interesting way.

English is a world language. Most of the schools have this language as a first or second language. Sometimes kids find it easy to speak. But while writting they make lot of mistakes, due to their lagging spellings skills. 

So the 1st purpose of this app, is learning spellings by an innovative method. When solving the quiz Kids won't feel, they are studying. 

Parents will see it as a better option to keep kids busy, instead of watching TV or playing games.

Built to use on the go, on the mobile phone, on a tablet or a computer, it is also a nice online platform for adults, who want to learn english language.

### Features left to implement

-   In the future I would like to add a timer for the quiz. User should answer each question within some fixed number of seconds.When the given time is over next question will appear automatocally.
-   It would be also a nice idea to create login-id for the user. We can save the score for each profile. In this way we could track user's progress when he plays the quiz each time.
